## Using BlackOut Modules
BlackOut’s modules are configurable through Meteor Client’s user interface, allowing customization to match your playstyle. Here’s how to use some key modules:

- **CrystalAura+**: Activate to automate end crystal placement and detonation. Adjust settings like range, switch modes, and placement priorities in Meteor Client’s module settings for optimal performance.
- **BedAura**: Enable to automatically use beds as explosives in combat. This is most effective in the Nether or End, where beds explode on use.
- **PacketFly**: Turn on for fast, packet-based flight. Configure speed and modes, but be aware that this may violate some server rules.
- **Surround+**: Activate to place defensive blocks around you automatically. Customize block types and placement patterns in the settings.
- **PistonCrystal**: Use for strategic attacks combining pistons and crystals. Experiment with settings to align with your combat strategy.

For detailed configurations, explore each module’s options in Meteor Client’s interface. Some modules may have advanced settings for fine-tuning.
