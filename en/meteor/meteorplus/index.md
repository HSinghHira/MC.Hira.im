**Meteor Plus** is an addon for Meteor Client, a widely used Minecraft mod that offers various hacks to enhance gameplay. Meteor Plus extends Meteor Client by adding "blatant" features, which are advanced cheats designed to bypass anti-cheat systems on Minecraft servers. These features cater to players who want to gain advantages in player vs. environment (PvE) and player vs. player (PvP) scenarios, such as flying, moving faster, or ignoring anti-cheat restrictions. The addon is popular among mod users, with over 16,000 downloads and a strong community presence.
