## Supported Minecraft Versions

Based on the latest releases available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HUHNcode/Lucid-addon/releases), Lucid supports Minecraft version 1.21.4. All documented releases, from v0.1.1 to v0.1.4, are tailored for this version, suggesting that 1.21.4 is the primary supported version as of June 2025. The installation guide on the repository mentions downloading Lucid for "your Minecraft version," which may imply potential support for other versions, but no evidence confirms this. For now, players should assume compatibility with 1.21.4 only.

| Release Version | Minecraft Version |

| Lucid v0.1.4    | 1.21.4            | 
| Lucid v0.1.3    | 1.21.4            |

## Key Features and Modules

Lucid provides a diverse set of modules that enhance various aspects of Minecraft gameplay, particularly focusing on chat enhancements and ESP functionalities. Below is a detailed list of all modules, along with their descriptions:

| Module Name          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chat Bot**         | Automatically detects and responds to chat messages using configurable settings. It employs regular expressions to extract messages and filters them based on keywords. ([ChatBot Docs](https://github.com/HUHNcode/Lucid-addon/blob/master/docs/ChatBot.md)) |
| **Chat Fonts**       | Allows customization of chat message font styles, such as Block, Blackletter, Bold, or Script, for a unique visual experience. ([ChatFonts Docs](https://github.com/HUHNcode/Lucid-addon/blob/master/docs/ChatFonts.md)) |
| **AFK Log**          | Logs you out automatically after a set AFK period, with options to detect inactivity and disable AutoReconnect. |
| **Auto GG**          | Sends a "GG" message after a kill, with customizable random or predefined messages and private messaging options. |
| **Auto Totem**       | Equips a Totem of Undying automatically when one is consumed, with a random delay to bypass anti-cheat systems. |
| **Anti Item Destroy**| Blocks crystal and anchor use briefly after a nearby player dies to prevent item destruction. |
| **Better Macros**    | Opens the chat with predefined text and cursor position via keybind, ideal for quick commands (e.g., `k::/say hello $c world`). |
| **Multi Command**    | Executes multiple commands in sequence, separated by a delimiter (e.g., `/home && /kit daily`). |
| **Stronghold Finder**| Assists in locating strongholds by triangulating positions based on two eye of ender throws, displaying estimated coordinates in chat. |
| **Packet Logger**    | Logs network packets for debugging or analysis, with options to filter incoming (S2C), outgoing (C2S), or both packet types. |

These modules can be configured directly within the Meteor Client interface, offering flexibility to suit individual playstyles. The combination of chat-focused and utility modules makes Lucid versatile for both casual and competitive players.
