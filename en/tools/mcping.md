# Minecraft Server Ping Tool
## Introduction

The Minecraft Server Ping Tool is a Vue.js-based web application designed to check the status of multiple Minecraft servers simultaneously. By entering server IP addresses, users can quickly retrieve detailed information about each server's availability, player count, version, and more. This tutorial explains what the tool does, how to use it, and why it stands out compared to other similar tools.

## What Does the Tool Do?

The Minecraft Server Ping Tool allows users to:

* **Check Server Status** : Determine whether a Minecraft server is online or offline.
* **Retrieve Server Details** : Fetch information such as:
  * Player count (online/maximum players).
  * Server version and software.
  * Message of the Day (MOTD).
  * Whitelist status (whether enabled or disabled).
  * List of online players (if available).
* **Ping Multiple Servers** : Process multiple server IPs at once, with a progress bar to track completion.
* **Handle Errors Gracefully** : Display CORS-related warnings and fallback to multiple APIs to ensure reliability.

The tool uses three external APIs (**`mcsrvstat.us`**, **`mcapi.us`**, and **`mcstatus.io`**) to gather server data, automatically switching between them if one fails due to network issues or CORS restrictions.

## Why Is It Better?

This tool offers several advantages over other Minecraft server status checkers:

1. **Multi-Server Support** : Unlike many tools that limit checks to one server at a time, this tool allows users to input multiple server IPs (one per line) and processes them concurrently, saving time.
2. **Robust API Fallback** : By leveraging three different APIs, the tool increases reliability. If one API fails, it automatically tries another, reducing the likelihood of errors.
3. **User-Friendly Interface** :
   * **Progress Tracking** : A progress bar shows the completion percentage while pinging servers.
   * **Clear Results** : Results are displayed in visually appealing cards, with color-coded status badges (green for online, red for offline, yellow for checking).
   * **Responsive Design** : The tool adapts seamlessly to mobile and desktop devices.
4. **CORS Awareness** : The tool detects and informs users about CORS-related issues, offering suggestions like using a local web server or a different browser.
5. **Detailed Insights** : Beyond basic status checks, it provides comprehensive details like whitelist status and player lists, which are not always available in other tools.
6. **Customizable and Open-Source** : Built with Vue.js, the tool is modular and easy to extend or integrate into other projects.

## Limitations

* **CORS Restrictions** : Browser security may block API requests, especially when running locally without a server.
* **API Dependence** : Relies on third-party APIs, which may have rate limits or downtime.
* **Whitelist Detection** : Whitelist status is inferred and may not always be accurate.
* **No Real-Time Updates** : The tool pings servers once per request; continuous monitoring requires manual re-pinging.
