## Introduction

The **Litematic Schematics Viewer** is a Vue.js and Three.js-based web application designed to visualize Minecraft **`.litematic`** schematic files in a 3D environment. It allows users to upload Litematic files, render their block structures with accurate Minecraft textures, and interact with the 3D model through rotation and zooming. This tutorial provides an overview of what the tool does, its limitations, and SEO metadata to optimize its discoverability.

## What Does the Tool Do?

The Litematic Viewer Tool enables users to:

* **Load and Parse Litematic Files** : Upload **`.litematic`** files (a schematic format used by the Litematica mod) and parse their NBT (Named Binary Tag) data to extract block information.
* **Render 3D Models** : Display the schematic as a 3D model using Three.js, with blocks rendered using Minecraft textures and accurate geometries for specific blocks like ladders, rails, buttons, trapdoors, carpets, and beds.
* **Support Block Properties** : Handle block states (e.g., orientation of ladders, rail shapes) to ensure accurate rendering based on properties like facing, shape, or open/closed states.
* **Interactive Controls** :
  * Click and drag to rotate the view.
  * Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
  * Press the '**W**' key to toggle wireframe mode for debugging.
* **Debugging Support** : Display detailed debug information (e.g., block palette, texture loading, geometry details) and visual aids like colored debug cubes (red for ladders, blue for rails) and an axis helper (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue).
* **Texture and Model Integration** : Fetch Minecraft block definitions and models from local JSON files (`data.min.json, models.min.json`) and textures from a `/textures/block/` directory to apply authentic visuals.
* **Handle Large Schematics** : Render up to 50,000 blocks with caching for textures, materials, and geometries to optimize performance.

The tool is ideal for Minecraft builders, modders, or server administrators who need to preview Litematic schematics in a browser-based 3D viewer.

## Limitations

* **File Size and Performance** : Limited to rendering 50,000 blocks to prevent browser performance issues. Large schematics may be truncated.
* **Local Asset Dependency** : Requires local JSON files (`data.min.json, models.min.json`) and texture files in `/textures/block/`, which must be hosted correctly to avoid loading errors.
* **CORS Issues** : When running locally without a web server, CORS restrictions may prevent texture or data loading.
* **Partial Block Support** : While it handles specific blocks (e.g., ladders, rails) with custom geometries, some complex block models may fall back to a default cube geometry.
* **No Real-Time Editing** : The tool is view-only and does not support editing or saving modified schematics.
* **Browser Compatibility** : Requires a modern browser with WebGL support for Three.js rendering.
* **Error Handling** : Invalid Litematic files or missing assets may result in fallback rendering (e.g., a red cube) or error messages, which may not be intuitive for all users.
